# Ecommerce-Ads-Analysis

The Problem: Our ad budget was being split evenly across Google, Meta, and TikTok without knowing which one truly drove profit.

The Discovery: Through this analysis, I identified that Tik Tok Ads has the highest ROAS at 9.538564.

Conversely, Google Ads had the lowest return.

The Business Impact: By shifting 20% of the underperforming budget from Google Ads to Tik Tok Ads, the company can expect a projected revenue increase of approximately $200,000 annually without spending an extra penny on ads.
